# Omazon
Omazon, an online shopping app made by a group of students from the University of Malaya.

Group members:
- CHOO XIANG LUN
- TEEA YU XUAN 
- SURENTHAR A/L RAJAMOHAN
- HAM ZHI YING
- ENG JUN CHENG

We faced several issues along the way:
1. Hard-coding our gmail account credentials into the source code makes our account vulnerable
   -> prevented by using json file to store our gmail account credentials and avoid pushing the json file to GitHub

2. Difficult to work together using traditional approach 
   -> solved by using GitHub to share our code.
   
3. Local database only accessible for one team member 
   -> We use an online free database server.
   
4. Track who is using the app.
   -> We store the user's information just when they login to our app using a class.
